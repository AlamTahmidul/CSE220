# CSE220

The following programs were done as homework assignments using MIPS Assmebly (MARS GUI) for CSE 220: Systems Fundamentals I:

* hw1 (Using MIPS)
    * Identify Components of I-type Instruction
        * Getting the opcode
        * Getting the register source (rs) field
        * Getting the register to (rt) field
        * Getting the immediate (i) field
    * Determine if the appropriate hexadecimal is even/odd
    * Count the number of 1s present in a hexadecimal string
    * Using a IEEE 754 format, determine:
        * Exponent
        * Mantissa
* hw2 (Calculator using stacks)
    * Evaluate expressions
        * Addition/Subtraction
        * Multiplication/Division
* hw3 (Mancala)
    * Create the game of Mancala following traditional rules
        * Moving to the relative "right" of the player's turn
        * Adding/Removing stones from mancala
        * Adding/Removing stones from player pockets
        * Stealing stones when the condition is met
        * Printing out the board in command line/text file
* hw4 (Social Network/Create Connections)
    * Using a node as a person, an edge as a relationship to another person
        * Trees of connections are created to determine if a person is already in the
          network or needs to be added (Add/Remove Nodes)
        * Adding relationships between people (Add/Remove Edges)
        * Checking if a person is a friend of friend
* hw5 (Polynomial Calculator)
    * Adding N terms to a given polynomial
    * Get the Nth term of a given polynomial
    * Modifying polynomial (Changing the Nth term, Removing terms)
    * Adding/Subtracting polynomials
    * Multiplying polynomials
